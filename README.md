# EnviroDIY_DemoApp
LimnoTech’s EnviroDIY demo site was created using Rmarkdown, leaflet, and shiny in order to illustrate the capabilities of near-real time environmental sensor data. Leaflet, in this example, is used to display a shapefile of a pond’s watershed with the option to display street maps or aerial imagery. The tidyverse packages are employed in the data caching and processing components of this Rmarkdown document.
